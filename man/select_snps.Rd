\title{Selects SNPs for inclusion in MR by comparing per-variance effect sizes.}
\usage{
select_snps(sumstats, p_thresh = 1e-05, welch_thresh = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{sumstats}{List with elements "beta_hat", "se_hat", "n_mat", and
"p_value", each M x D matrices.}

\item{p_thresh}{Float, p-value threshold to use for SNP inclusion.}

\item{welch_thresh}{FLOAT, p-value threshold for Welch test of equal betas.}
}
\value{
A list of lists. The outer list is indexed by the phenotype names.
  Each inner list is also indexed by the phenotype names, and the value of
  result$P1$P2 is a boolean vector of length M corresponding to the SNPs to
  use in the estimation of TCE of P1 on P2 for all SNPs meeting p_thresh.
  on P1. The names of these SNPs are stored in the entry $names.
}
\description{
Notes: sumstats passed to this function must be computed on the per-variance
scale. This function does twice as much work as necessary.
